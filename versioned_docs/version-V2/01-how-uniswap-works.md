Welcome to the Astraly documentation.

The pages here contain conceptual and technical documentation of Astraly protocol and application.

You'll find here what we're building, and where we're heading.

If you are new to Uniswap, you might want to check out the [Protocol overview](../V2/concepts/protocol-overview/how-uniswap-works) first.

## Developer links

The V2 Uniswap protocol is separated across two repositories

- [`uniswap-v2-core`](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-core)
- [`uniswap-v2-periphery`](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-periphery)

The V2 SDK, which can assist developers when interacting with the Uniswap V2 Protocol can be found here.

- [`uniswap-sdk`](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-v2-sdk)
- [`uniswap-sdk-core`](https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-sdk-core)
