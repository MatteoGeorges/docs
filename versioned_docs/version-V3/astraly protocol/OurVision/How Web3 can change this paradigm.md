Web3, namely the decentralized web, can offer multiple possibilities to users. We see the future of web3 as allowing all users to own their content, including their social graph, achievements and publications. From there, each user chooses when connecting to an application whether or not to share their content, or only a part of it, making user privacy very flexible, and allowing personalized experiences based on the data shared by the user.
The fact that the user owns their data, and the right to distribute it or not, also allows interoperability not available on the web2, with the possibility to bring their content from one application to another and to get a different and customized experience each time. All this is allowed by the fact that developers can build any application on top of the different graphs shared by the user.

From there, any feed algorithm can be built, and we will probably see a multitude of applications build their algorithm, and propose new experiences to users from the same social graph. No more single algorithm from Facebook or Twitter, you will be able to use a custom algorithm that fits your needs and expectations. A lot of value will be captured by the applications offering the most balanced algorithm and allowing simple and effective customization of content, between shitposting, friends, news, educational content and more.
