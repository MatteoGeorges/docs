Identifiers are therefore badges, non-transferable, that give context to each address on the blockchain. We think there will be a lot of applications providing different types of badges, either testifying to IRL activities (e.g. POAPs), or web2 activities (e.g. X person have 10k followers on Twitter, Y contributed to a Starkware repository on Github...) or web3 activities (e.g. X person mined a cryptopunk, or Y owned ETH before the DAO hack).

All these identifiers will potentially be generated by different applications, but will - hopefully - have a common standard. Once we have adopted these identifier providers, we need aggregators, and algorithms, to make sense of this information, and that's where Astraly comes in. We build the infrastructure layer to aggregate all these identifiers, injecting them into a graph, and giving the tools to sort and filter the different information coming from the identifiers. Imagine being able to choose your own algorithm provider for your feed, based on your preferences, personalize your content and more. This type of experience is what can allow millions of web2 users to move to web3, with a drastic change in their control over their content, as well as what is offered to them.
