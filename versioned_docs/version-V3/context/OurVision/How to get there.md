Web3 is currently in a similar state to web1 in its early days. By this we mean that we have a bunch of applications that allow us to do a lot of different things, like writing on-chain newsletters, exchanging and creating NFTs, following on-chain accounts etc... All these on-chain actions and information are not curated or not curated enough. To be able to organise all this information, it seems necessary to be able to qualify the relationships between the different on-chain accounts, in order to display them in a graph. Simply, the accounts that everyone can observe on-chain are all anonymous, and the only relationships available between the accounts are the financial flows. While anonymity is probably a desirable property, it does not help us to create context and links between accounts. Furthermore, economic capital is not sufficient to create context, and the introduction of social capital is necessary for the pursuit of our goal. Social capital has different properties from economic capital, as the former is non-tradable, non-transferable and context-dependent, while the latter is tradable, transferable and context-independent. These properties are theorised in the [**Usefeeds Whitepaper**](https://knowen-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/file/1990/Userfeeds_Protocol_Whitepaper_Draft.pdf) in the form of vertical and horizontal relevance.

Hence, since social capital is non-transferable, it cannot be represented on-chain in the same way as economic capital, which is represented in the form of predominantly ERC-20 assets. This is what Vitalik Buterin, Glen Weyl and Puja Ohlhaver have called [**"Soulbound"**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763), which is accompanied by the SoulBound Token, a non-transferable token standard. These tokens are identifiers, giving context to anonymous addresses and allowing them to be pseudonymous. These identifiers also allow us to establish links between the addresses of the network, and thus to be able to construct graphs.
