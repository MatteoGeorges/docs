The arrival of the Internet, with the HTTP or SMTP protocols, created standards for computers to communicate with each other. These protocols established the rules of communication between two devices connected to the Internet, which allowed the democratization of information, and its access for all. As the Internet was adopted, more and more information and content were made available.
However, the attention that anyone can give to the available content is limited. Indeed, although the average amount of time spent browsing the internet has increased over the years, our time is still limited. There is an asymmetry between limited attention time and the exponentially increasing content available. This trend will only amplify with AI-generated content.

The problem of sorting by relevance the content shown to users has been solved by the application layer in web2, and giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. Indeed, the latter have implemented algorithms allowing their users to find the content best suited to their behaviour. This behaviour is built from the different clicks, likes or purchases that the user makes while browsing the internet. As the algorithms absorbed more user data, they were able to offer better curation, and the network effect works like this: more users allow for more data to be collected, which allows for better curation of content, thus attracting ultimately more users, and so on. This network effect also encouraged the companies developing these algorithms to keep user data hidden from the outside world, in order to maintain a competitive advantage over competitors, by ensuring that the latter did not possess enough information to compete in curation.

Nevertheless, this system has proven its limits, especially by locking its users in their curation system, which makes them powerless, always controlled by the narrative that the platform wants to give. The data is hidden, the algorithm is controlled by the company developing it, and users cannot turn to other solutions as competitors do not have the data for curation, so users become agents exploited by the algorithms to extract the maximum possible value through advertising. A [**2018 paper by Chris Dixon**](https://onezero.medium.com/why-decentralization-matters-5e3f79f7638e) describes how these centralized applications move from cooperation to competition with their developers, creators and businesses, and from attraction to extraction with their users as their success grows.

This leads us to think about a better solution in order to free the user from their enclosure in these applications. Web3, based on decentralization and open source, aims to fix this problem. Indeed, we can build open, open source and decentralized networks to remedy this problem. However, thinking that a simple ideological point of view will allow millions of users to abandon their centralized applications for decentralized ones is a big mistake. We have a duty to propose a real change in user experience, bringing real change for the better. We need to bring an experience that is impossible to achieve on web2, and that addresses real user issues, not just ideological ones.

## How Web3 can address those problems

Web3, namely the decentralized web, can offer multiple possibilities to users. We see the future of web3 as allowing all users to own their content, including their social graph, achievements and publications. From there, each user chooses when connecting to an application whether or not to share their content, or only a part of it, making user privacy very flexible, and allowing personalized experiences based on the data shared by the user.
The fact that the user owns their data, and the right to distribute it or not, also allows interoperability not available on the web2, with the possibility to bring their content from one application to another and to get a different and customized experience each time. All this is allowed by the fact that developers can build any application on top of the different graphs shared by the user.

  <div>
  <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://4086585041-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FG0TggWALo9xfCaYfuNXI%2Fuploads%2FQ426NI2FUuLFQxejogkl%2FScreenshot%202022-09-14%20at%2015.10.42.png?alt=media&token=de9b6c12-8b48-4f02-bf81-f02b5183fc8e" />
  </div>

From there, any feed algorithm can be built, and we will probably see a multitude of applications build their algorithm, and propose new experiences to users from the same social graph. No more single algorithm from Facebook or Twitter, you will be able to use a custom algorithm that fits your needs and expectations. A lot of value will be captured by the applications offering the most balanced algorithm and allowing simple and effective customization of content, between shitposting, friends, news, educational content and more.

## How to get there

Web3 is currently in a similar state to web1 in its early days. By this we mean that we have a bunch of applications that allow us to do a lot of different things, like writing on-chain newsletters, exchanging and creating NFTs, following on-chain accounts etc... All these on-chain actions and information are not curated or not curated enough. To be able to organise all this information, it seems necessary to be able to qualify the relationships between the different on-chain accounts, in order to display them in a graph. Simply, the accounts that everyone can observe on-chain are all anonymous, and the only relationships available between the accounts are the financial flows. While anonymity is probably a desirable property, it does not help us to create context and links between accounts. Furthermore, economic capital is not sufficient to create context, and the introduction of social capital is necessary for the pursuit of our goal. Social capital has different properties from economic capital, as the former is non-tradable, non-transferable and context-dependent, while the latter is tradable, transferable and context-independent. These properties are theorised in the [**Usefeeds Whitepaper**](https://knowen-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/attachment/file/1990/Userfeeds_Protocol_Whitepaper_Draft.pdf) in the form of vertical and horizontal relevance.

  <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://4086585041-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FG0TggWALo9xfCaYfuNXI%2Fuploads%2FymYEcJ54S7wbVEJ7fmLn%2FScreenshot%202022-09-14%20at%2016.45.28.png?alt=media&token=faf5360f-6998-489b-a4f4-755defe1531d" />

Hence, since social capital is non-transferable, it cannot be represented on-chain in the same way as economic capital, which is represented in the form of predominantly ERC-20 assets. This is what Vitalik Buterin, Glen Weyl and Puja Ohlhaver have called [**"Soulbound"**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763), which is accompanied by the SoulBound Token, a non-transferable token standard. These tokens are identifiers, giving context to anonymous addresses and allowing them to be pseudonymous. These identifiers also allow us to establish links between the addresses of the network, and thus to be able to construct graphs.
