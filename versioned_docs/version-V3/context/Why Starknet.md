The Astraly protocol is built on the Starknet Validity Rollup. The use of Starknet in our architecture is more than an ideological or market choice, it is guided by the technical characteristics necessary for the protocol architecture. Thus, Starknet is currently the only chain that can support our architecture, for several reasons. Before we get into the details of why Starknet is the only blockchain that can host Astraly's infrastructure, let's talk about why the Ethereum ecosystem is the ideal place to build an application.

When thinking about choosing an ideal environment to build the decentralised reputation architecture we have imagined, one of the first factors we took into account is the 4-5 year horizon. Web3 is still very young, and it is therefore quite complex to project a long-term vision, but Astraly is here to stay, and it is important to use and work on a technology that will be adopted and used by all in a horizon of several years. From there, Ethereum and its ecosystem are an obvious choice, as the current technical fundamentals are ahead of other blockchains, and the long-term vision is aligned with the needs of society.

From there, Starknet is for us the ideal place to develop Astraly, as their vision is aligned with Ethereum's, while offering reduced gas costs, thanks to validity proofs. Although we are in the early days of Starknet, we fully share their vision, and are eager to see the evolution of the chain over time, especially on the issues of network decentralisation, and Cairo adoption.

Now, the main reason for choosing Starknet is to have the technical capacity to support Astraly. Indeed, in the pursuit of a trustless and decentralised architecture, we have the ambition to build a protocol that does not rely on any third party. From the distribution of badges to the creation of graphs, we want to have a system that allows anyone, without any constraint, to create custom reputation systems for their use case, all supported by our architecture. From there, a very interesting primitive, and still little exploited, is storage proofs. Mainly developed and democratized by Fossil, storage proofs allow to cryptographically prove, and on-chain on Starknet, any state of the Ethereum ecosystem, including the beacon chain as well as the layer 2 and side chains. This tool allows proving activities and achievements anywhere on the Ethereum ecosystem, in a transparent and trustless way. It is therefore an essential component of Astraly's architecture, and available only on Starknet.

Moreover, all the calculations performed in order to generate graphs, and to factor and exploit them require a high computational capacity. This is easily provided by Starknet, which has opted to build its own VM optimised for validity proofs.

All of these elements converged towards the decision to build Astraly on Starknet, and there could be no other alternative.
