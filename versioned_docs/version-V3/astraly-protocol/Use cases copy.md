Reputation has a use case for any application already live, or for any user of the blockchain, and even anyone not using the blockchain. In fact, using the blockchain as a place to store credentials, social graphs and more solves a lot of problems, including those discussed in the introduction. From there, we build the architecture to accommodate the next wave of users, who will be able to use their digital reputation without even knowing they are using the blockchain for that.

There are many use cases, here is a collection of use cases, if you are a builder and want to get some ideas, or if you are just interested in the use cases of on-chain reputation.

## Governance

Governance is one of the use cases we are most excited about. Indeed, almost no human organization today is based on a Plutocracy type of governance, i.e. a governance based on wealth. Until now, in the Web3 world, we have only used token voting, and therefore a system that is not very fair, making the organizations sometimes not very functional.
Astraly will change everything, and bring a reputation based voting, making web3 organizations more functional and fair.
Moreover, since Snapshot X is currently being developed on Starknet, reputation based voting will be very easily accessible for all organizations in the Ethereum ecosystem.
The reputation based voting can rely on several algorithms available on Astraly. Indeed, a first reputation score of the project, including the different contributions, social interactions, and evaluating the involvement of the users can be calculated. Then, it is possible to combine this with a clustering algorithm, which will identify close actors, with common interests, and potentially bots. From there we can build fairer governance systems, and allow better on-chain organizations.

## Gaming

On-chain gaming is still a nascent field on Starknet, but has a bright future. Indeed, the composability promised by on-chain gaming will take the industry to another level. Hence, a reputation aggregation system between the different on-chain games will be very important for achievements and matchmaking. If each game sets up its own reputation system, not on-chain, the lack of composability will be a problem. With Astraly's infrastructure, games will be able to directly integrate their on-chain reputation system, and gamers will have their profile directly accessible for all games, and will benefit from this reputation system, for matchmaking or different achievements.

## Create a loyalty system for your community/project

The token incentives currently built in most projects are based on a single verifiable on-chain factor, and are very inefficient. In the future, projects will be able to build their own on-chain loyalty system, based on the contributions of the different actors to the ecosystem, and thus control the incentives for all the actors of a network. We are currently working on making this use case a very simple one for projects, with a setup in a few clicks.

## Gate access based on reputation

The fact that all components of the reputation system are on-chain makes it very easy for developers to integrate scores and badges directly into their contracts on Starknet and elsewhere, and thus to gate some access to certain features of smart contracts based on reputation.

## Personalized curation

As explained in the introduction, curation has become more important than creation. Nevertheless, curation algorithms, especially in Web2, have shown their limits, with too little personalization possible, and the total control of the narrative imposed on the user who cannot escape from this domination. In Web3, we will have all the content available on-chain, owned by the users. From there, to curate this content, personalized algorithms can be created to give the best curation for each user, depending on what he wants to see. These algorithms will be based on the personalized scores created by any user, and will offer a personalized curation of the content.
