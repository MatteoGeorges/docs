Astraly is an organization developing [**on-chain reputation primitives**](/docs/test) and a [**reputation based token distribution platform**](/docs/test).
We’re building on StarkNet [**(Learn why here)**](/docs/test), our smart contracts are [**open-source**](/docs/test) and we’re currently [**live on testnet**](https://testnet.astraly.xyz).

## Our Vision

On-chain reputation is an underexploited vertical in the web3 space and can become a major tool for projects to reward their communities, create better governance models, and many exciting use cases.
We’re focusing on building primitives in order to make on-chain reputation mainstream and easily usable by any project in a trustless way.
